_Slay the Spire_ is a Steam Game, a rogue-like deck builder.
I have played a lot of it, so I wanted to learn more about some stats over time.

Currently have python scripts that parse out my win ratio for me. Future work could be done on more specific things like win ratios of certain cards/relics/choices but I might not have enough data for that to be relevant.
